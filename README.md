# 🔍 Mini AI Search Engine for PDFs

An AI-powered Streamlit app that lets you upload multiple PDFs (e.g. Radiography lecture notes or any course material), ask questions in natural language, and get answers with source references.

Built to support different reasoning styles using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **ChromaDB**, this app offers 3 powerful answer modes:

- ✅ **Strict** — answers strictly from retrieved content  
- 🌀 **Loose** — uses flexible context matching with MMR  
- 🤖 **Enhanced** — lets the LLM refine, validate, and rephrase the response
